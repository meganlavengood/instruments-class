For this analysis symposium, choose one of the options below to analyze. But please also listen many times to the other piece, since we will be discussing both in class.

## Song options

### Option 1: Billie Eilish, "you should see me in a crown" (2018)

I have provided .mp3 files of the original and of an isolated vocal track I created using Izotope RX (as suggested by Duguay) on Teams.

    <p>[Verse 1]</p>
    <p>bite my tongue, bide my time<br/>
    wearing a warning sign<br/>
    wait till the world is mine<br/>
    visions i vandalize<br/>
    cold in my kingdom size<br/>
    fell for these ocean eyes
    </p>
    <p>[Chorus]</p>
    <p>you should see me in a crown<br/>
    i'm gonna run this nothing town<br/>
    watch me make 'em bow<br/>
    one by one by one<br/>
    one by one by
    </p>
    <p>[Chorus]</p>
    <p>you should see me in a crown<br/>
    your silence is my favorite sound<br/>
    watch me make 'em bow<br/>
    one by one by one<br/>
    one by one by one
    </p>
    <p>[Verse 2]</p>
    <p>count my cards, watch them fall<br/>
    blood on a marble wall<br/>
    i like the way they all<br/>
    scream<br/>
    tell me which one is worse<br/>
    living or dying first<br/>
    sleeping inside a hearse (i don't dream)
    </p>
    <p>[Bridge]</p>
    <p>you say<br/>
    come over, baby<br/>
    i think you're pretty<br/>
    i'm okay<br/>
    i'm not your baby<br/>
    if you think i'm pretty
    </p>
    <p>[Chorus]</p>
    <p>you should see me in a crown<br/>
    i'm gonna run this nothing town<br/>
    watch me make 'em bow<br/>
    one by one by one<br/>
    one by one by
    </p>
    <p>[Chorus]</p>
    <p>you should see me in a crown<br/>
    your silence is my favorite sound<br/>
    watch me make 'em bow<br/>
    one by one by one<br/>
    one by one by one
    </p>
    <p>[Chorus]</p>
    <p>crown<br/>
    i'm gonna run this nothing town<br/>
    watch me make 'em bow<br/>
    one by one by one<br/>
    one by one by
    </p>
    <p>[Chorus]</p>
    <p>you should see me in a crown (you should see me, see me)<br/>
    your silence is my favorite sound (you should see me, see me)<br/>
    watch me make 'em bow<br/>
    one by one by one<br/>
    one by one by one

## Assignment

### Prepare for discussion {{site.wed07}}

Here are the guidelines for the symposium (regardless of which song you choose):

-   Make sure your analysis is based on the methodology used by one of the authors we've read thus far {% cite theberge_musical_2017 bates_actor-network_2018 tresch_toward_2013 wright_picked_2024 le_guin_cello-and-bow_2006 de_souza_beethovens_2017 gotham_pitch_2016 cole_hands_2024 eidsheim_maria_2017 malawey_quality_2020 duguay_analyzing_2022 barna_vocal_2024 %} and that you state clearly how you're using that methodology.
-   Come to class on Wednesday prepared to share something interesting about your chosen option—something that you discovered through that methodology. You don't necessarily have to account for everything in the song, and it's okay for this to be kind of a work-in-progress.
-   Depending on what your methodology is, you might get the bset information not only listening to studio recordings, but also watching videos of live performances to inform your analysis. I've provided several links for each song for this reason. Feel free to explore other recordings. Be sure to keep track of what recording you're referencing in your analysis.
-   Listen to the other song a bunch too, even though you won't work as hard at analyzing it, so you can still participate in discussion of it.

### Homework due {{site.sun07}}

-   Flesh out and formalize the analysis you shared on Wednesday. This time, try to come to some interesting analytical conclusion about the song you studied—a kind of answer to the question "so what?"
-   Make a note of what effect our class discussion had on your analysis—did someone draw your attention to something you hadn't noticed? Did someone else analyze something differenly and you prefer their way to what you had originally? etc.
-   Try making some kind of visual example/diagram/figure/table that helps illustrate your analysis.

Save your work as a PDF with the prefix `07` and upload to `homework-submit`.
