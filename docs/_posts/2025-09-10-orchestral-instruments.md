These readings focus on Western orchestral instruments and are thus perhaps more traditional representations of organology.

## Week 3

### Reading due {{site.wed03}}

-   {% reference le_guin_cello-and-bow_2006 %}
-   {% reference de_souza_beethovens_2017 %}
    -   Discussion leader: Yechan

### Homework due {{site.sun03}}

Revisit a piece you've performed in the past, and see if you can identify passages of music where the technical physical execution of the music reveals different connections than a more traditional analysis would. Explain those physical sensations. Screenshot or photograph relevant passages of the score and include them in your response.

If you try for a while but don't succeed at finding anything interesting, you could write about that too. Do you think the physical execution is coordinated with the motives? Or is there some other hypothesis you can come up with?
