I've saved (what is in my opinion) the best for last: synthesized instruments. Synthesizers are one of my main research interests.

## Week 11

We won't be having class on {{site.wed11}} because I'll be traveling to Minneapolis for the annual [Society for Music Theory conference](https://minneapolis2025.ams-smt.org)! Instead I'll ask us to do kind of virtual, asynchronous class session.

If you are interested in the conference (it's cool! if you like music theory!), you can pop into the [free livestreamed sessions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LKCJoYjstjG5xFiL8fUttvmGATtiB_RAg8CDuHX1N-U/edit?gid=0#gid=0). The conference runs Nov 6–9. **Important note: the times are given in CST because the conference is in Minneapolis, so subtract one hour to get to EST.**

-   My presentation is Thursday Nov 6 at 4pm (3pm EST).
-   Two sessions about Expression in Vocal Music are relevant to our seminar topic. One is Thursday Nov 6 at 10:45am (9:45am EST) AM and the other is Saturday Nov 8 at 10:45am (9:45am EST).
-   The last paper in the Music and Games session (Tracing Percussion Orchestration in Early NES Soundtracks (1983-1987): Understanding Coded Parameters Through FFT Analysis) is also relevant to our seminar. Since it's the last paper on the session, it will begin at 10am (9am EST), on Friday Nov 7.My presentation is Thursday Nov 6 at 4pm (3pm EST).

### Reading and homework due {{site.wed11}}

-   Read {% reference lavengood_timbre_2019 %}.
-   Post one (1) question **for me to answer** on Teams. I've made a special channel for this called "Lavengood Sonic 3 discussion". I'll do my best to answer these quickly or when I have downtime at the conference.

### Homework due {{site.sun10}}

-   Post at least twice more in the "Lavengood Sonic 3 discussion" channel, either as a reply to my reply or to another student. Please try to make your comments substantive, not just "nice job!" or "I agree!" Try to make it something equivalent to having participated in a normal class session.
