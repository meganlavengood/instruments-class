## Week 1

In our first class ({{site.wed01}}), we'll do some housekeeping—going through the syllabus, getting you acquainted with Teams and the course website, and introducing ourselves.

As part of your introduction, please plan to talk a bit about your primary instrument (voice is an instrument!), what other instruments you may play and in what contexts, and any other information that might be pertinent to your interest in this seminar topic.

I'll alsp make a brief presentation on a couple important readings: [{{site.reading01}}. I recognize some of you may not have time to do this reading before the first class, but you'll probably get more out of class if you do.](/bibliography/#bibliography)
