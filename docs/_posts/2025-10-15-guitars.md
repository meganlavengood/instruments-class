Guitars are foundational in Anglo/American popular music and have been the focus of a large amount of scholarship. Drum kits have been given less scholarly attention by comparison, but pose unique and interesting questions for the instrument-focused analyst.

### Homework due {{site.sun08}}

Analyze Bernard Purdie's drumming on the **alternate take** of "Rock Steady" by Aretha Franklin ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/rock-steady-alternate-mix-young-gifted-and-black-outtake/1533475563?i=1533477504), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/4uImPJrSWX7dyw26fQ8E3z?si=cdc5eef443d94c1a)). Create a table similar to Smith's Table 14.1. I've begun the table for you to help you out a little, since the form is pretty ambiguous! Fill in the phrasing, beat pattern, and fill columns to the best of your ability. Write a couple sentences about what the analyis process revealed to you (if anything!).
