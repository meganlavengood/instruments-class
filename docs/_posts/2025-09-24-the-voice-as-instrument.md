Analyze some part of the vocals of “you should see me in a crown” by Billie Eilish (2018). Your work should be inspired by Duguay and Barna but doesn’t need to strictly adhere (especially in Duguay’s case, since she uses a lot of special software). I have provided .mp3 files of the original and of an isolated vocal track I created using Izotope RX (as suggested by Duguay) on Teams. Write 250–500 words on your findings, save as a PDF, and upload to your `homework submit` folder.
