### Homework due {{site.sun05}}

I've found two different recordings of Luciano Pavarotti singing his signature aria, "Nessun Dorma," from Puccini's _Turandot_:

1. [A 1979 performance (if YouTube is to be believed)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3ecaM5UjAA&list=RDM3ecaM5UjAA&start_radio=1)
2. [A 2006 performance, the last he ever gave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxxHvW0oNpU)

After completing these readings, what do you make of these two performances (and feel free to bring in others if you wish) and how they differ? Malawey and Eidsheim consider physical changes to the bodies (i.e., the instruments) of the singers they discuss as well as the social contexts and reception of the performances—try to do the same. [Here's a link to the score](<https://s9.imslp.org/files/imglnks/usimg/5/54/IMSLP13537-Puccini_-_Nessun_Dorma_(Voice,_Piano).pdf>) and [Wikipedia's translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessun_dorma#Context_and_analysis).

Write 250–500 words on your findings, save as a PDF beginning with `05`, and upload to your `homework submit` folder.
