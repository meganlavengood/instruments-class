## Week 6

### Reading due {{site.wed06}}

-   {% reference duguay_analyzing_2022 %}

    -   Alyssa Barna will be joining us to discuss her article!

### Homework due {{site.sun06}}

Analyze some part of the vocals of “you should see me in a crown” by Billie Eilish (2018). Your work should be inspired by Duguay {% cite duguay_analyzing_2022 -A %} and Barna {% cite barna_vocal_2024 -A %} but doesn’t need to strictly adhere (especially in Duguay’s case, since she uses a lot of special software). I have provided .mp3 files of the original and of an isolated vocal track I created using Izotope RX (as suggested by Duguay) on Teams. Write 250–500 words on your findings, save as a PDF, and upload to your `homework submit` folder.
